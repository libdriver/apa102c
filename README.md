## LibDriver APA102C
[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/apa102c/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE) 

APA102C for the three-color RGB LED dimming control string Then IC,using the CMOS process, providing three-color RGB LED output driver to adjust the output with 256 gray-scale and 32 brightness adjustment APA102 with two-output WAY ,the CLK signal by synchronization, so that the crystal cascadePiece of output movements synchronized.

LibDriver APA102C is the full function driver of apa102c launched by LibDriver. APA102C provides led writing and other functions. LibDriver complies with MISRA.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver APA102C source files.

/interface includes LibDriver APA102C SPI platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver APA102C driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver APA102C sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver APA102C offline document.

/datasheet includes APA102C datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface SPI platform independent template and finish your platform SPI driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example write

```C
#include "driver_apa102c_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
static uint32_t gs_rgb[21]; 
static uint8_t gs_temp[1024];

/* init */
res = apa102c_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

/* write color */
for (i = 0; i < 21; i++)
{
    gs_rgb[i] = APA102C_COLOR(color >> 16, color >> 8, color >> 0, 16);
}

/* write data */
res = apa102c_basic_write(gs_rgb, 21, gs_temp, 1024);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)apa102c_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* close the chip */
res = apa102c_basic_deinit();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}
else
{
    return 0;
}
```
